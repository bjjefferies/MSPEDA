BEA Regions are a set of Geographic Areas that are aggregations of the states. The regional classifications, which were developed in the mid-1950s, are based on the homogeneity of the states in terms of economic characteristics, such as the industrial composition of the labor force, and in terms of demographic, social, and cultural characteristics. BEA groups all 50 states and the District of Columbia into eight distinct regions for purposes of data collecting and analyses.  IPEDS/HEGIS assigns U.S. service schools as their own region.

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.

Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as "the 1890 land-grants."  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the "1994 land-grants."

All institutions that participated in Title IV federal financial aid programs were first separated into degree-granting and nondegree-granting groups by control of institution (public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit). 

Degree-granting institutions were divided into the following groups using the institution category variable: graduate and 4-year primarily baccalaureate and above; 4-year primarily associate's; and 2-year degree-granting. The Carnegie Classification Basic 2021 was then used further classify degree-granting institutions within the 4 groups. The highest degree offered was used for 4-year degree-granting institutions that did not have a carnegie classification. 

The majority of nondegree-granting institutions were grouped by their largest program. The largest program was based on the largest program identified by the cipcode, that the institution reported on the student cost section of the institutional characteristics component. The programs are business (52), communications and communication technologies(09,10), cosmetology(12.04), engineering and engineering technologies(14,15) , manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation (46,47,48,49) and health (51). All other cipcodes were combined for the other programs category. 

When the above methodolgy yielded small comparison groups (< 4 schools), groups of different controls maybe combined or a 4-year primarily associates maybe combined with a 4-year baccalaureate and above group. 

When the above methodology yielded large groups (greater than 40), groups were further subdivided by size, based on 12-month enrollment, (See cosmetology groups above). 

Special groups were made for the Tribal colleges, U.S. service institutions, and institutions in other jurisdictions, such as Puerto Rico.

Prior to the 2018 data feedback reports Distance learning "Only" institutions were classified as one group. Beginning with the  2018 report distance learning "Only" were classified based on their Carnegie Classification. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'

Category descriptions:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer a Master's degree, Doctor's degree  or a First-professional degree and do not offer a Bachelor's degree or an Associate's degree. 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree,Doctor's degree or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. 

3) Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctor's degree,or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.

4) Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less-than two academic years; at least two but less-than four academic years. This category also includes institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate, Post-master's certificate or a First-professional certificate and the highest degree offered is an Associate's degree.

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctor's or First-professional degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate, Post-master's or First-professional certificates. 

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's , Master's, Doctor's, or First-professional degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level. They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less than two academic years; or at least two but less than four academic years.

Technical details for Institutional Category (INSTCAT):

Total degrees and certificates and total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded are derived using data from the Completions component.

Total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree is the sum of: 

Bachelor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
Postbaccalaureate certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
Master's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
Post-master's certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
Doctor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above added to the following:

Associate's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years 
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=4, MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year 
    (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

Institutions are classified as Degree-granting (DEGGRANT=1) or Nondegree-granting(DEGGRANT=2) using level of offerings data reported on the Institutional Characteristics component. Degree-granting institutions offer an Associate's (LEVEL3=1),Bachelor's (LEVEL5=1, Master's (LEVEL7=1), Doctoral (LEVEL9=1), or a First-Professional (LEVEL10=1) degree. Any institution that offers only certificates are Nondegree-granting.

Nondegree-granting institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate (LEVEL6=1) or a post-master's certificate (LEVEL8=1) or a First-professional certificate (LEVEL11=1) are classified as Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate (INSTCAT=5).

Nondegree-granting institutions that only offer certificates of less-than four academic years are classified as Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate (INSTCAT=6).

Degree-granting institutions whose highest degree granted are Associate's (HDEGOFFR=40) are classified as Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates (INSTCAT=4). (There are a few 4-year institutions that grant Postbaccalaureate or Post-master's or First-professional certificates in this category).

Degree-granting institutions that do not grant a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5=0) and do not grant an Associate's degree (LEVEL3=0) are classified as Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees (INSTCAT=1).

The remaining degree-granting institutions offer a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, or both.
For these institutions a percent of bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree of  total degrees and certificates is generated. If the percent is greater than 50, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=2), If the percent is 50 or less, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=3).

Inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. All Non-Title IV institutions that did not respond to the  IC or Completions components were coded as not reported. 
Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
New degree-granting institutions that report offering a bachelor's degree on the current institutional characteristics file for the upcoming academic year, and have not yet reported bachelor's degrees on the current completions that covers the previous academic year  June 1-July 30 were assigned as follows:

If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above. If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above.

For institutions that reported zeros for bachelor's degrees of above and for levels below the bachelor's, the maximum number of programs by level was used to determine the primary classification. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Disc</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>15210</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived - IPEDS, Fall 2023, IC and Completion components</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Directory information, institution classifications, and response status information</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Directory information, institution classifications, and response status information</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>HD2023</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;' ><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Code Value</td><td>&nbsp;Value Label</td><td>&nbsp;Frequency</td><td>&nbsp;Percentage</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;3</td><td>&nbsp;Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above</td><td>&nbsp;438</td><td>&nbsp;19.04</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;1</td><td>&nbsp;Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees</td><td>&nbsp;4</td><td>&nbsp;0.17</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;4</td><td>&nbsp;Degree-granting, associate's and certificates</td><td>&nbsp;1</td><td>&nbsp;0.04</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;5</td><td>&nbsp;Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate</td><td>&nbsp;1</td><td>&nbsp;0.04</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;2</td><td>&nbsp;Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above</td><td>&nbsp;1857</td><td>&nbsp;80.70</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>C21BASIC - Carnegie Classification 2021: Basic</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in the early 1970s to support its research program. The Basic Classification was originally published for public use in 1973, and subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018 and 2021. The 2021 update includes only minor changes. Specifically, the label “Tribal Colleges” has been changed back?to “Tribal Colleges and Universities”. In addition, there is a newly created category “Special Focus Research?Institution”, comprised of the special focus?institutions?that meet the criteria for being considered a “Research University” but confer degrees in a limited range of academic programs. Additionally, the special focus categories of “Engineering Schools” and “Other Technology-Related Schools” have been combined into a single category. 

Classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on 2019-20 data.  For the full definition and methodology go to https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/classification_descriptions/basic.php

Doctoral universities - Includes institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees during the update year and also institutions with below 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees that awarded at least 30 professional practice doctoral degrees in at least 2 programs. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

The first two categories include only institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees and had at least $5 million in total research expenditures (as reported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Higher Education Research & Development Survey (HERD)).

R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity
R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity
D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities

Master's Colleges and Universities - Generally includes institutions that awarded at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year (with occasional exceptions – see Methodology). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate Colleges - Includes institutions where baccalaureate or higher degrees represent at least 50 percent of all degrees but where fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees were awarded during the update year. (Some institutions above the master's degree threshold are also included; see Methodology.) Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges - Includes four-year colleges (by virtue of having at least one baccalaureate degree program)  that conferred more than 50 percent of degrees at the associate's level. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Associate's Colleges - Institutions at which the highest level degree awarded is an associate's degree. The institutions are sorted into nine categories based on the intersection of two factors: disciplinary focus (transfer, career & technical or mixed) and dominant student type (traditional, nontraditional or mixed). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Special Focus Institutions- Institutions where a high concentration of degrees is in a single field or set of related fields. Excludes Tribal Colleges.

Tribal Colleges - Colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, as identified in IPEDS Institutional Characteristics.

Classification focuses attention on undergraduate education, regardless of the presence or extent of graduate education. Undergraduate education is an essential component of what most colleges and universities do, as the vast majority of U.S. institutions of higher education teach undergraduates. Indeed, even at institutions with strong commitments to graduate education and the production of new knowledge through research and scholarship, the undergraduate program usually accounts for the majority of student enrollment.

In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusion.

The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded (master's degrees, and doctoral degrees categorized as either research/scholarship, professional practice, or other doctorate), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that award at least one research/scholarship doctoral degrees (hereinafter referred to as research doctoral degrees), and one postbaccalaureate degree-granting institutions that either offer only master's degrees or that also offer professional practice or other doctoral degrees (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, institutions are classified respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.

For two categories of institutions offering research doctorates, institutions offering medical education (defined as human or veterinary medical education, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine) were distinguished. Institutions in other categories may also offer medical education, but the numbers were not large enough to justify subcategories, and judged it preferable to differentiate with respect to the other graduate fields, rather than with respect to the presence or absence of medical education.

NOTE: Because a single research doctoral degree (as defined in the IPEDS data collection of the National Center for Education Statistics) qualifies an institution for inclusion in the doctoral categories, institutions with large master's or professional programs and modest doctoral-level programs are currently classified according to their doctoral programs.
The categories are listed below. The term "comprehensive" is used here to denote comprehensiveness of offerings across a range of fields.

Exclusively undergraduate institutions are further disaggregated by level (two-year and four-year). For institutions with both undergraduate and graduate students, institutions are grouped according to the distribution of full-time equivalent (FTE*) students across the two levels, giving an approximate measure of the student population's "center of gravity." As a result, it reflects important differences with respect to educational mission as well as institutional climate and culture—differences that can have implications for infrastructure, services, and resource allocation.

The Basic Classification was originally published for public use in 1973, and subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. In the 2018 update, the Doctoral Universities have been reshaped to better accommodate “Doctor's degree – professional practice” within our methodology. Please see the Basic Classification Methodology for details regarding how this classification is calculated.

Doctoral universities - Includes institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees during the update year and also institutions with below 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees that awarded at least 30 professional practice doctoral degrees in at least 2 programs. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

The first two categories include only institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees and had at least $5 million in total research expenditures (as reported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Higher Education Research & Development Survey (HERD)).

R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity
R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity
D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities

Master's Colleges and Universities - Generally includes institutions that awarded at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year (with occasional exceptions – see Methodology). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate Colleges - Includes institutions where baccalaureate or higher degrees represent at least 50 percent of all degrees but where fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees were awarded during the update year. (Some institutions above the master's degree threshold are also included; see Methodology.) Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges - Includes four-year colleges (by virtue of having at least one baccalaureate degree program)  that conferred more than 50 percent of degrees at the associate's level. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Associate's Colleges - Institutions at which the highest level degree awarded is an associate's degree. The institutions are sorted into nine categories based on the intersection of two factors: disciplinary focus (transfer, career & technical or mixed) and dominant student type (traditional, nontraditional or mixed). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Special Focus Institutions- Institutions where a high concentration of degrees is in a single field or set of related fields. Excludes Tribal Colleges.

Tribal Colleges - Colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, as identified in IPEDS Institutional Characteristics.

The 2005 edition involved some significant changes from the previous releases by dividing Associate's colleges into subcategories and using a multi-measure research index to classify doctorate-granting institutions. The 2010 update retained the same classification structure as the 2005 edition. In the 2015 update, the Associate's Categories were substantially redefined and the categories of the Research Doctoral Universities changed (but not the calculation methodology). Please see the Basic Classification Methodology for details regarding how this classification is calculated.

Note: The "shorthand" labels for the Doctoral Universities and Master's Colleges and Universities were restored in the 2015 update to numeric sequences (R1, R2, R3, and M1, M2, M3) to denote that each one is based on differences in quantitative levels. For doctoral universities, the levels are based on a research activity index and for master's colleges and universities it is based on number of degrees conferred.

Doctoral Universities - Includes institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees during the update year (this does not include professional practice doctoral-level degrees, such as the JD, MD, PharmD, DPT, etc.). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note- Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 to support its research program, and later published in 1973 for use by other researchers. Although this classification has undergone many changes over the years, the current release involves some significant changes from previous editions.

This variable is derived from the enrollment by race/ethnicity section of the fall enrollment survey. The full-time equivalent of the institution's part-time enrollment is estimated and then added to the full-time enrollment of the institution. This formula has been used to produce the full-time equivalent enrollment that is published annually in the Digest of Education Statistics. The full-time equivalent of part-time enrollment is estimated by multiplying the part-time enrollment by factors that vary by control and level of institution and level of student. The following factors were used:

Part-time undergraduate enrollment (line 22) 
Public 4-year .403543
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .392857
Public 2-year and <2year .335737
All other sectors .397058
First professional (line 23)
Public 4-year .600000
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .545454
Graduate (line 25)
Public 4-year .361702
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .382059

Bachelor's degree	- An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least 4 but not more than 5 years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes all bachelor's degrees conferred in a 5-year cooperative (work-study) program. A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies. Also includes bachelor's degrees in which the normal 4 years of work are completed in 3 years. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>84129</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR -  IPEDS Winter 2023-24, Outcome Measures component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Outcome measure rates </td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Outcome measure rates </td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVOM2023</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;100</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;46</td><td>&nbsp;28.94</td></tr></table></body></html>
